Hello!
Welcome to gfx Creator! 
Follow these steps carefully to know how to use it!

First make sure to not open any of the files inside of it or it wont work!
Then go on chrome
Click the three dots and go to extensions! Make sure to hover ur mouse over extensions and click "Manage Extensions"

Once u do it will take you to ur extensions. At the top there will be Developer mode enable that then load unpacked.

After that you go in this folder into GFX-CreatorTesting-main then into another clone of GFX-CreatorTesting-main then there will be another file

Just click on that once, then open
TO know if it is the right one make sure under it there is the .gitkeep! Thanks for testing
